    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>Petra is a historical and archaeological city in <strong>Southern Jordan</strong>. It is famous
        for its <strong>rock-cut architecture</strong> and <strong>water conduit system</strong>. Petra is also known as the <strong>"Rose City"</strong> due to the color
        of the stone from which it is carved. It was established as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the <strong>Nabataean
        Kingdom.</strong> Petra is a <strong>UNESCO</strong> World Heritage Site and one of the <strong>New Seven Wonders</strong> of the World.</p>
