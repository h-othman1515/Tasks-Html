    <h1>My name is Hanan Othman</h1>
    <h2>I'm almost 23 years old.</h2>
    <h3>I've graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
        From Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan.</h3>

    <p>As a talented web developer, I'm passionate about crafting beautiful, accessible websites that deliver
        exceptional user experiences. My interests extend beyond coding—I'm an avid swimmer who loves staying active in
        the water, a creative artist who enjoys working with various mediums, and a book lover who finds inspiration
        through literature. One of my favorite films is <strong>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</strong>,
        which showcases masterful storytelling through its perfect blend of action, emotion, and cinematography. I'm
        constantly exploring emerging web technologies and am deeply committed to mentoring others and sharing knowledge
        through hands-on projects and real-world examples in the field of web development.</p>
